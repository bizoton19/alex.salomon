***Role: Software Engineer***

* I served as the lead developer and systems integration architect in all Enterprise Metadata related development including designing the domain layer and the data access layer using the repository pattern for all common business processes.
* I have experience engineering software by promoting the extreme programming practices specifically, continuous integration and small releases, collective code ownership and leading iteration planning meetings. 
* I successfully implemented service oriented architecture that bridges the individual metadata ETL systems by self-hosting WCF trigger services with dynamic base address configuration and net/tcp bindings. The WCF services are consumed by Java and .Net clients across the Social Security Administration using both RESTful and SOAP.
* I Engineered the API to the Enterprise Metadata Repository which uses complex communication sequences to pull data from source code manager residing on the Z/os platform to the Windows environment using technologies such as WebSphere MQ for Java, SOAP web services and TCP/IP.
* I designed and implemented an ASP.NET MVC application that allows users to upload their COBOL source code packages for scanning or request a specific set of COBOL or Assembler programs to be scanned and loaded in the repository for impact analysis.


***Intranet/Web***

* I implemented the enterprise metadata search engine based of the Lucene API
* I modeled the components  participating in the extraction of data from multiple sources using a data structure inheritance model which allows all indexed data to be searched on by a google like search ASP.Net web interface using the agency’s enterprise user experience framework with 508 compliancy.

***Data***

* I have worked with Database Administrators to design, develop and/or update databases as they relate to web applications. 
* Collaborate with the database support branch to manage and develop new database structures in DB2 for the enterprise metadata repository in a coordinated fashion then migrate the changes up the lifecycle after regression testing.
* I have worked with database administrators to design, implement and test reuse rule stored procedures.
* I have worked with the database administrators and enterprise data architect to design and develop the enterprise metadata load database (SQL Server) which includes entities that house information for batch processing loads and tables that help drive the intranet load automation website.
* In preparing for a possible end of life of the CA repository metadata management tool, I researched, proposed and developed a pluggable metamodel architecture.
