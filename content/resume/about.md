***Sept 09, 2009 to Jan 9,2015***: 

Social Security Administration Headquarters  

***Primary Project: Enterprise Metadata Repository***:

The enterprise metadata repository aimed to unify half a century worth of diverse and volatile metadata across the agency into a unified repository that's searchable, enrichable, provides insight on the state of mission critical systems and enables impact analysis across systems and subsystems. To accomplish this goal, we identified 3 phases:

1. Identify the current types of systems and design the metadata repository metamodels to be as felixible as possible.
2. Automate the discovery, transformation and loading of the metadata repository by Integrating third party tools and in-house developed tools in several phases.
3. Design and develop a search and export tool for the enterprise.

**Architecture and Back End Development:**

As the lead developer on the project, i quickly learned The z/OS environment to scope out the integration points between amongst platforms then took the initiative to design, in `C#` then converted to `Java`, a CA Endevor source code inventory ETL tool which would extract metadata about COBOL and JCL modules from the Endevor file and stage that information in a relational database. With tousands of duplicate files/folders being sent to the server daily, i was able to **decrease the load time by 50% using memoization which led to a daily 20% match in database to COBOL module relationship in the metadata repository.**

**Custom Web Search Tool:**



Sept 21, 2004 to 2009: Valencia Community College, Enrollment Services, Orlando, FL

***Support Specialist I***:

* My major success story while working as a support specialist was finding creative ways to design a system that would improve the student recruitmnent processes while gradually **cutting cost by about 12% for the departement every year**. this was accomplished by collaborating across functional teams to identifying flaws, major problems or areas that can use improvement in various recruitment processes.
